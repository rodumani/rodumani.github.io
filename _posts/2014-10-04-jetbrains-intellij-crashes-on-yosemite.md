After installing OS X 10.10 Yosemite GM, jetbrans&#8217; products, IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorms crashes when launching them.

It was simple issue that OS X default Java has some problem. Apple has already released new Java. 

Although installing Java from Oracle, OS X&#8217;s java applications need Apple Java. (I don&#8217;t understand why..)

Just download Java for OS X 2014-001 and install to solve problem.
